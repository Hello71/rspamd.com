Today, we release the new major version `1.6.0` of Rspamd. The most significant change in this version is the addition of Milter protocol support in Rspamd. Therefore, Rmilter project is finally turned to the abandoned state and should not be used in new installations. All Rmilter users should consider migration to Rspamd milter support. This release has some incompatible changes so please check the [migration guide]("{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/migration.html").

Here is the list of most noticeable changes. The full list is available on the [changes page]("{{ site.baseurl }}/changes.html").

## Milter protocol support

From Rspamd 1.6, rspamd proxy worker supports `milter` protocol which is supported by some of the popular MTAs, such as Postfix or Sendmail. The introduction of this feature also finally obsoletes the [Rmilter](https://rspamd.com/rmilter/) project in honor of the new integration method. Milter support is presented in `rspamd_proxy` **only**, however, there are two possibilities to use milter protocol:

* Proxy mode (for large instances) with a dedicated scan layer
* Self-scan mode (for small instances)

Here, we describe the simplest `self-scan` option:

In this mode, `rspamd_proxy` scans messages itself and talk to MTA directly using Milter protocol. The advantage of this mode is its simplicity. Here is a sample configuration for this mode:

~~~ucl
# local.d/worker-proxy.inc
milter = yes; # Enable milter mode
timeout = 120s; # Needed for Milter usually
upstream "local" {
  default = yes; # Self-scan upstreams are always default
  self_scan = yes; # Enable self-scan
}
~~~

For more advanced proxy usage, please see the corresponding [documentation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/workers/rspamd_proxy.html).

## ARC support added

There is full support of [ARC](http://http://arc-spec.org/) signatures and seals for emails scanned in Rspamd 1.6.0. ARC signatures can establish that a specific message has been signed and then forwarded by a number of trusted relays. There is a good overview of the `ARC` standard here: <https://dmarc.org/presentations/ARC-Overview-2016Q2-v03.pdf>.

Rspamd [ARC module]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/arc.html) supports both **verification** and **signing** for outbound messages. Its configuration is very similar to [dkim_signing module]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/dkim_signing.html).

## New statistics model for Redis storage

Rspamd 1.6 includes experimental support for new tokens storage in Redis. In this scheme, it is easier to get data about specific tokens and perform tokens expiration. However, this support is not enabled by default in this release but you can try it as well as Bayes expiration plugin by yourself. In future releases, this model will be the default and you will be able to convert the existing storage to the new scheme without data loss.

## New expiration algorithm for internal caches

Rspamd now has an implementation of Least Frequently Used (LFU) algorithm instead of the classic Least Recently Used (LRU) used before. The idea comes from the [Redis server](http://antirez.com/news/109) where it has been used for a long time. With this algorithm, Rspamd will cache frequently used items for longer time and the overall performance of the caches is expected to be better.

## DMARC reports support

[DMARC module]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/dmarc.html) now supports reports sending (using SMTP smarthost) for specific domains and policies. There are many options available for fine tuning of these reports content, frequency, domains and many other. DMARC reports are intended to provide better feedback for the resources that are using DMARC (e.g. `paypal.com`) from their recipients. Namely, they can detect some phishing trends and react to them somehow.

## Spam trap plugin

New plugin [spam trap]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/spamtrap.html) has been added to Rspamd to simplify spamtraps organization. This plugin allows to learn fuzzy storages or/and Bayes from some honeypots.

## URL redirector improvements

There are various changes in [url redirector module]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/url_redirector.html). Namely, it now expires processing items more aggressively to avoid leftovers. Some of dependency issues have also been resolved. Furthermore, this plugin now has a list of top redirection destinations allowing to deal with some bad URLs exploited by spammers.

## Multiple metrics support has been removed from Rspamd

From version 1.6, multiple metrics support is now completely removed from Rspamd. The only valid metric is now `default`. This feature has never ever been used since version `0.2` of Rspamd, however, it consumed some resources and introduced extra complicatinons to the protocol and configuration.

Hence, this feature has been removed and the new endpoint `/checkv2` has been added to the protocol. The legacy `/check` and `/symbols` endpoints are still using old protocol definition and they will be used for backward compatibility in future.

## Compression support in proxy

Rspamd proxy now supports transport compression when sending messages to the scanning layer.

## Various performance improvements

Here is a list of significant performance related changes:

* Hfilter regular expressions now can use hyperscan
* DKIM body hash is now cached to improve multiple signatures support
* Snowball stemmers are also cached for better performance


## Miscellaneous

Here is a list of other changes made in this release: 

* Various rules fixes (`FORWARDED`, `URI_COUNT_ODD` and others)
* Bugfixes and other improvements
* New Lua API functions
